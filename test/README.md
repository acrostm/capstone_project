# Pose Estimation and Analysis Web Application

## Overview

This project utilizes Flask to create a web application that processes video streams for real-time pose estimation and analysis. It employs the MediaPipe library for accurate pose detection and PyTorch for evaluating poses against trained models. The application can count specific exercises (e.g., curls, squats, bridges) and provide feedback on performing them correctly.

## Features

- Real-time pose estimation in video streams.
- Exercise counting and analysis (curls, squats, bridges).
- Feedback mechanism for exercise improvement.
- Lightweight Flask web server for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer
- Flask
- MediaPipe
- PyTorch
